Turn 2: Yeah , that's very important .
Turn 3: So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment .
Turn 4: I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
Turn 5: That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
Turn 6: It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
Turn 7: It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
Turn 8: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
Turn 9: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
Turn 10: It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
Turn 11: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
Turn 12: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
Turn 13: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
Turn 14: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
Turn 15: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
DialoGPT: 

Turn 0: Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?
Turn 1: Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic .
Turn 2: Yeah , that's very important .

DialoGPT: 

Turn 0: Have you ever tried shopping online ?
Turn 1: No , never . I prefer to actually see and touch what I'm buying before I pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes .
Turn 2: That's right . Seeing is believing .
Turn 3: I've heard some friends say when they get the article , it's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement .
Turn 4: That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .
Turn 5: What's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
Turn 6: It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
Turn 7: I can't agree more . that's why I only do street shopping .
Turn 8: Me too . Sometimes I surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
Turn 9: That's a good idea .

Turn 0: So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...
DialoGPT: The board of directors is the board of directors.

Turn 0: So tell me , what's the difference between the Board of Directors , the CEO , and the stockholders ? They all seems ot be the same group of people to me ...
Turn 1: No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased .
