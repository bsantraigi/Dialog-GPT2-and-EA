Turn 3: I'm sorry to hear it . What's wrong with her ?
Turn 4: Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .
Turn 5: You need a babysitter .
Turn 6: Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights .
Turn 7: I could have Suzy stay at my place .
Turn 8: I don't want to do that to you , Karen .
Turn 9: Why not ?
Turn 10: Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days .
Turn 11: I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely .
Turn 12: I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight .
Turn 13: I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible .
Turn 14: I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older .
Turn 15: I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself .

Turn 4: I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
Turn 5: That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
Turn 6: It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .
Turn 7: It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
Turn 8: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
Turn 9: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
Turn 10: It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
Turn 11: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
Turn 12: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
