Turn 1: yes . How about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ?
Turn 2: great , let's go !
Turn 3: hey , darling , I think I might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . I was so relaxed . It felt as if I were in another world .
Turn 4: exactly . You know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . You remember ? The island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ...
Turn 5: yes , it was wonderful but it's already been a year . How time flies !
Turn 6: why not go again to celebrate out one-year anniversary ? We can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant .
Turn 7: are you kidding ? Can you afford it ? Do you think we can get a room on such short notice ?
Turn 8: never mind that , I'll take care of it . Are you available next week ?
Turn 9: yeah , I think so .
Turn 10: ok . I'll make the arrangements . It will be great .
Blender: [' Yes, I am available next week.  I would love to go to the beach with you.']
